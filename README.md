This page is for capturing theta z video and displaying it in Quest2.
I only have the theta z and quest2, so I have not tested it for other theta series or VRHMD.
If you want to use other theta series (or other panorama camera), please check the resolution and frame rate in chrome://media-internals and rewrite the resolution and frame rate in the source code to those parameters. Other VRHMDs should work as long as they support WebXR.
